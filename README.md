### win10-defender-off HID attack

#Arduino code

Arduino code for  Disable windows 10 defender ( make for Digisparks )

```
A ducky script that disables Windows defender, then clears the action center prompt
NOTE: this is only tested on the windows 10 1607 build, AKA the anniversary edition.
Most older machines will probably need more delay
```

```
NOTE: This compiler is dependent on NicoHood's HID.
You need to add it to the Arduino IDE Library.
